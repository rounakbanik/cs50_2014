0.  A lung disease caused by inhaling fine ash and sand dust. 
1.  Returns resource usage measures or statistics.
2.  16 (14 primitives + 2 structures)
3.  This is because the second argument in the getrusage() function is a pointer and hence, it is required that we pass the address of the variable as the argument.
4.  The for loop basically checks for each word by reading the text character by character, detecting the formation of a word and then checking its spelling.
    First, the index (which calculates length of the word) is set to 0. The program keeps reading character by character until it reaches a non-alphabetic character.
    At this stage, the program assumes the formation of a complete word and proceeds to check if the spelling is correct.
    Simultaneously, the program also records the amount of time required to perform the execution.  
5.  There might be certain alphanumeric strings which we do not want to analyze. fgetc() ensures that we only detect alphabetic words.
6.  Because we want the function to be implemented only if checking and loading are successful i.e check and load have value 1.
7.  Hash table and linked lists.
8.  0.80 seconds
9.  Used a better hash function (djb2 function)
10. Code cannot detect repetition of words while listing misspelled words.
